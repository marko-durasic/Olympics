## Custom Filters for Olympic Data Analysis

This repository aims to provide custom filters for analyzing Olympic data in a more comprehensive and insightful manner. By leveraging these filters, we can identify the best-performing athletes per capita, per team sport, and even combine similar sports to generate consolidated results. Additionally, we can consider the popularity of each sport by incorporating the number of registered global players as a factor in determining competitiveness.

### Per Capita Analysis

With the per capita filter, we can evaluate the performance of athletes relative to the population of their respective countries. This allows us to identify countries that excel in producing top-performing athletes despite having a smaller population.

### Team Sport Analysis

The team sport filter enables us to analyze the performance of countries in team-based Olympic events. By aggregating the results of individual athletes within a team, we can determine which countries dominate in specific team sports.

### Consolidated Sport Results

In some cases, it may be beneficial to combine similar sports to generate consolidated results. For example, swimming events can be merged into a single sport category to evaluate the overall performance of athletes in aquatic disciplines.

### Popularity-Based Analysis

To account for the popularity of each sport, we can incorporate the number of registered global players as a factor in determining competitiveness. This allows us to assess the level of competition in each sport and identify the most fiercely contested events.

We encourage contributions from the community to enhance these custom filters and expand the capabilities of our Olympic data analysis. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute content, please refer to our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
