/**
 * TODO
 * 
 * Possible idea: a wrapper for the Olympic API, providing custom filters and additional functionality.
 * Not sure if it can be monetized, such as a paid service or application.
 * Additionally, it can be used to create a website with features like a blog, forum, and advertisements, focusing on sports-related content(already showing the data from the API).
 * 
 * Please note that this is a general idea and further development is required to implement the mentioned features.
